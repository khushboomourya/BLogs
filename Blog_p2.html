  <p>“Worldwide, an estimated 55 million people experience an eye injury each year, with 1.6 million developing blindness, 2.3 million developing bilateral low vision, and almost 19 million developing unilateral blindness or low vision.”- BMJ Best Practice</p>
  <p>Such risks are prevalent in industrial and construction settings worldwide, where workers are exposed to dust, debris, chemicals, and flying particles.</p>
  <p>Eyes are particularly vulnerable in these high-risk environments. From grinding metal to cutting tiles or handling hazardous chemicals, even a split-second lapse in eye protection can cause irreversible damage. This is where KARAM safety eyewear steps in. As a trusted name in Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), we focus on providing uncompromising eye protection in harsh working conditions.</p>
  <p>In this blog, we have discussed how KARAM safety eyewear offers protection in challenging work environments.</p>

  <h3>Common Hazards in Industrial and Construction Sites</h3>
  <p>
    There are a variety of risks involved in harsh environments, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Flying particles from metal and woodwork.</li>
    <li>Dust and sand in construction zones.</li>
    <li>Sparks and flashes during welding or grinding.</li>
    <li>Chemical splashes in laboratories and manufacturing units.</li>
    <li>UV and infrared radiation during electrical or welding tasks.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Reliable, high-impact eye protection is crucial in activities like drilling, sawing, sanding, and welding. Lack of proper eyewear in these scenarios often leads to eye strain, injuries, and long-term vision loss.</p>
