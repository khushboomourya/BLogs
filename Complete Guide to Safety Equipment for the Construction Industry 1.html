      Construction is a demanding and risk-prone profession. It involves working
      at elevated work platforms, using power tools, heavy machinery, and
      volatile materials. From erecting buildings to making bridges and other
      infrastructure, the construction industry is a modern-day powerhouse of
      innovation and progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The International Labor Organization (ILO) states that the construction
      industry accounts for one in five workplace fatalities globally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind every milestone is a team of workers exposed to serious risks every
      day, be it from falling objects, sharp tools, hazardous materials, or loud
      machinery. This makes personal protective equipment (PPE) a survival
      toolkit, and not just a regulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Safety equipment is the first line of defense between a worker and a
      life-altering injury. From preventing falls to shielding the eyes from
      debris or insulating against electrical hazards, personal protective
      equipment (PPE) helps workers perform their tasks safely and confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this blog, we have discussed every major category in construction PPE
      and explained their purpose, types, regulatory standards, and maintenance
      to help workers step into the field confidently, equipped with the
      knowledge they need to stay safe.
    </p>
